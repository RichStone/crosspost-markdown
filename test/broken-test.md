# Creating a Webflow <-> dev.to <-> GitHub cross-post integration tool ðŸš€

Ease the creation of webflow blog posts for developers and cross
posting across different channels.

## We are testing ðŸ”­ ðŸ§ª ðŸ”¬

I'm sorry you are seeing that because you shouldn't see this top-secret creation! With a bit of patience, you will have your integration at your fingertips soon ;)

This test document is used to check the rendering on the different platforms. If you are seeing it, we most likely pushed it somewhere public
by mistake ðŸ˜¬ Fail hard, fail fast, but fail!

## Overview

Have the source of truth in your own space at **webflow** or GitHub. Then automate or make it easier to cross-post at:

## lists

* webflow
* dev.to
* Medium
* codementor

1. Minimal
2. Viable
3. Product

```javascript
function go() {
  console.log('this is awezzzommme');
}
go();
```

And of course, the `inline code` is not different.

We will manage it, though!

> Sigue, insist, persist!
