# Write your blog in markdown and publish it on Webflow, dev.to, Medium & codementor

Ease the creation of webflow blog posts for developers and cross posting across
different channels like dev.to, Medium and codementor.

There is a big tutorial over at [fullstack.coach](https://fullstack.coach) to
get you started with your awesome technical developer blog! Learn there about
the best IWE (Integrated Writers Environment) for us techies and how CrossPost
supports it.

## We are testing ðŸ”­ ðŸ§ª ðŸ”¬

I'm sorry you are seeing that because you shouldn't see this top-secret
creation! With a bit of patience, you will have your integration at your
fingertips soon ;)

This test document is used to check the rendering on the different platforms. If
you are seeing it, we most likely pushed it somewhere public by mistake ðŸ˜¬ Fail
hard, fail fast, but fail!

## Overview

Have the source of truth in your own space at **webflow** or GitHub. Then
automate or make it easier to cross-post at:

## all those dev heavy platforms

* webflow
* dev.to
* Medium
* codementor

1. Minimal
2. Viable
3. Product

```javascript
function go() {
  console.log('this is awezzzommme');
}
go();
```

Also show some HTML code for the old schools:

```html
<div>Mount it for Good!</div>
<img src="mammont">
```

And of course, the `inline code` is not differently difficult but easier.

We will manage it, though!

> Sigue, insist, persist!

It's _not a coincidence that we are testing_ links by providing a link: [Egg
Laying Wool Milk
Pigs](https://fullstack.coach/post/what-is-a-full-stack-developer-or-how-to-become-an-egg-laying-wool-milk-pig)!

And an _awesome_ ~~picture~~ image!
